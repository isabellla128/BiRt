		<h3 typeof="schema:name">Security Considerations</h3>
		<div typeof="schema:description">
			<p>
                Security is a fundamental aspect of the development process for ArtistSearch, and every measure is taken to ensure the protection of 
                the data and interactions. The application leverages AWS IAM Roles (Identity and Access Management) to enforce strict access controls, 
                allowing only authorized entities to access specific resources, thus minimizing the risk of unauthorized access. 
                Additionally, all sensitive data stored within AWS is encrypted using industry-standard encryption protocols, ensuring that the data 
                remains secure both in transit and at rest. The use of encryption guarantees that any data transferred between users and the application 
                is protected from interception or tampering. 
            </p>
            <p>
                While security is always a priority, ArtistSearch does not require complex authentication mechanisms because the platform does not
                handle sensitive user data. ArtistSearch is a site designed primarily to display publicly available information sourced from Wikidata, 
                with additional filtering and data summarization features to enhance user exploration. Since the platform’s core function revolves 
                around providing music-related data (artists, genres, countries, and periods) without storing personal or confidential 
                information about users, there was no need for user authentication. All interactions are focused on exploring open data, and no 
                personal details are required or stored. This approach ensures that users can freely access the content and explore the data 
                without the risk of exposing sensitive information, keeping the platform simple, user-friendly, and secure.

                <p>
                    ArtistSearch employs a highly efficient and secure process for collecting, transforming, and storing data.
                     Information is retrieved from Wikidata through carefully crafted SPARQL queries executed by our 
                     Flask application hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SPARQL, as a powerful query language, allows us to query Wikidata’s structured knowledge base efficiently. 
                    For instance, we leverage non-trivial SPARQL queries to pull data on artists, genres, and related metadata, 
                    ensuring that we gather precise and relevant information for the platform’s users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One such complex query involves artist recommendations based on the following factors:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Genre Overlap</strong>: Artists who share at least one genre with the given artist are considered for recommendations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Birth Year Proximity</strong>: To ensure relevance, we select artists born within a ±5 year range of the given artist.</li>
                    <li><strong>Geographical Diversity</strong>: Artists from different countries are prioritized, ensuring that recommendations 
                        reflect a global perspective.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This query returns up to 10 recommended artists who meet these criteria, offering personalized and dynamic recommendations to the users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the data is collected, it undergoes necessary transformations to ensure the data 
                    aligns with the frontend’s requirements before being sent to users. This transformation 
                    guarantees data consistency and optimizes it for seamless interaction on the platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For storage, we use AWS Neptune, a graph database that efficiently handles complex, interconnected data,

			<h3 typeof="schema:name">Details regarding the Backend implementation</h3>
			<div typeof="schema:description">
				<p>At the backend of ArtistSearch, we’ve structured our system using microservices, which are represented by AWS Lambda functions. 
                    This architecture ensures that our application remains scalable, maintainable, and responsive, while allowing each component 
                    to perform its specific role efficiently.
                </p>

                <p>Each Lambda function is designed to handle a specific operation tied to a particular route in our application. 
                    This approach divides the workload into smaller, more manageable services that can be independently scaled, modified, 
                    and updated without disrupting other parts of the system.
                </p>
                <p>Here’s how our backend services interact:</p>


                <strong> <p>Microservices and Lambda Functions:</p> </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We organized the backend code into microservices, each represented by a dedicated AWS Lambda function. This allows us to decouple various components of our application, providing flexibility and ease of maintenance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each Lambda corresponds to a particular route or endpoint in our application. For instance, when a user makes a request to a specific route in the frontend, the application sends the request to an EC2 instance running a Python Flask server. The Flask server then invokes the appropriate Lambda function to process the request.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <strong> <p>Metadata Search Lambda:</p> </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In addition to the core Lambda functions, we have another specialized Lambda designed for searching metadata based on specific criteria, such as country or genre. This Lambda plays a vital role in gathering relevant information from the Wikidata API, as it streamlines the process of filtering the data according to user preferences and application requirements.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <strong> <p>Lambda for Caching:</p> </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To optimize response times and reduce the load on external data sources, we utilize caching. We have a dedicated Lambda function that manages cache operations. When a request is made, the relevant Lambda checks if the data is available in the cache. If it is, the Lambda will retrieve the cached data to provide a fast response.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the required data is not present in the cache, the Lambda triggers a process to query Wikidata for fresh data and stores the new results in both the cache and our graph database, AWS Neptune, for future use.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <strong> <p>Scheduled Data Cleanup (EventBridge Lambda):</p> </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To maintain the freshness and relevance of the data in the system, we use a scheduled cleanup process. We’ve implemented an AWS EventBridge rule that triggers a Lambda function every 24 hours. This function performs a data cleanup operation on the AWS Neptune database, removing any records that are older than 24 hours. This ensures that the data remains up-to-date and relevant for the user experience, while also optimizing the performance of the database.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <strong> <p>Request Processing Flow:</p> </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        When a client makes a request to a route in the ArtistSearch application, the request first goes to an EC2 instance running a Python Flask server. This server acts as the middle layer, which manages incoming requests and interacts with the necessary Lambda functions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The server checks whether the requested data is available in the cache by invoking the Lambda function responsible for managing cached data. If the data is found, it is returned to the user immediately, ensuring fast response times.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the cache does not contain the required data, the server sends a request to Wikidata, retrieves the necessary information, and saves it both in the cache and in AWS Neptune, the graph database. This ensures that the data is readily available for future requests. 
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <strong> <p>Data Management and Storage in Neptune:</p> </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        For storing and managing data, we rely on AWS Neptune, a graph database designed to handle complex, interconnected data efficiently. It enables us to store the relationships between various data points—such as artists, albums, genres, and countries—in a way that makes it easy to query and retrieve information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Data is transformed appropriately before being stored in Neptune, ensuring that it adheres to our predefined data models and is easily accessible for queries and recommendations.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <strong> <p>CloudWatch Monitoring for System Health:</p> </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Since the system relies heavily on various AWS services (Lambda, EventBridge, Neptune, etc.), we utilize Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and log aggregation. CloudWatch helps us ensure that the entire system is operating smoothly by providing real-time insights into service performance, error rates, and system health.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We set up monitoring across all AWS services in use. This allows us to be notified of any potential issues or failures and take corrective actions as quickly as possible. CloudWatch’s logging capabilities also enable us to trace the flow of requests and troubleshoot issues as they arise, ensuring that our backend architecture remains stable and reliable.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    artists available in the system. Users can filter this list based on time period, musical genre, 
                    or country of citizenship, making it easy to refine searches and focus on relevant results. These 
                    filtering options dynamically update the displayed artists and ensure that the rest of the page, 
                    including summary visualizations, remains consistent with the selected criteria.
				</p>
				<p>
					A key feature of the Artists Page is the ability to view artists and their relationships to musical 
                    genres in a graph visualization, created using D3.js and D3Plus. This feature, accessible through 
                    a dedicated button, presents an interactive network of artists and their associated genres, 
                    allowing users to explore connections and patterns within the dataset. The visualization updates 
                    based on the applied filters, ensuring that users always see relevant relationships.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another major feature on the Artists Page is the ability to compare two selected artists through 
                    a pop-up modal that displays their details side by side. This comparison includes several interactive 
                    charts and graphs, also implemented using D3.js and D3Plus, that provide insights into their musical careers, 
                    genre distributions, and other relevant attributes. The modal enhances user engagement by offering a 
                    deeper understanding of similarities and differences between artists.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to individual artist details and comparisons, the Artists Page includes a section dedicated 
                    to summary visualizations, where three key charts dynamically display the distribution of artists by 
                    country, genre, and decade. These visualizations provide a broader perspective on musical trends and 
                    patterns, offering users an overview of how artists are distributed across different categories. 
                    Like other elements of the page, these charts respect the active filters, ensuring that users can 
                    analyze specific subsets of data in a visually compelling manner.

                    Apart from artists, ArtistSearch also features a Genres Page, where users can explore all available musical genres. 
                    This page includes a filter panel on the left-hand side, allowing users to refine the displayed genres based on a 
                    selected country. The filtering mechanism ensures that users can discover musical genres that are prevalent in 
                    specific regions, adding another layer of interactivity to the exploration process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a user selects a specific genre, the application retrieves and displays detailed information about that genre, 
                    including its subgenres. Since subgenres are themselves categorized as genres, users can navigate further into the hierarchy, 
                    discovering relationships between different musical styles and how they have evolved over time. This hierarchical structure 
                    is crucial for understanding the complexity of music classification and is presented in an intuitive manner for easy navigation.

                <p>The frontend of the application is deployed using Amazon S3, allowing for scalable, secure, and cost-effective static file hosting. This ensures that the user interface remains highly available and performs efficiently.</p>
        
                <h4>AWS Elastic Beanstalk for Backend Deployment</h4>
                <p>The backend routes are deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, which abstracts infrastructure management while providing automatic scaling, load balancing, and monitoring for the Flask-based server.</p>
        
                <h4>AWS Lambda Functions</h4>
                <p>Lambda functions are used extensively for handling specific request processing tasks. Each function corresponds to a particular backend operation, such as data retrieval, processing, or insertion into Amazon Neptune.</p>
                <p>Additionally, a Lambda function is dedicated to interacting with Wikidata to fetch relevant information, while another function manages metadata retrieval for specific countries or music genres. A separate Lambda function within the same VPC as Neptune is responsible for caching data.</p>
        
                <h4>Amazon Neptune for Graph Database Storage</h4>
                <p>Neptune, hosted within a secure VPC, is used as a graph database to store and manage artist-related data. It ensures efficient querying of relationships and enables complex analytical operations on the dataset.</p>
        
                <h4>AWS EventBridge for Scheduled Cleanup</h4>
                <p>An AWS EventBridge rule triggers a Lambda function every 24 hours to remove outdated data from Amazon Neptune, ensuring that cached data remains relevant and accurate.</p>
        
                <h4>IAM Roles and Security Groups</h4>
                <p>IAM roles are configured to enforce fine-grained access control across AWS services. Security groups are particularly important for managing access between Lambda functions and Amazon Neptune, ensuring secure communication within the VPC.</p>
        
                <h4>Amazon CloudWatch for Monitoring</h4>
                <p>To ensure reliability and performance, CloudWatch is used to collect logs, metrics, and events from various AWS services. This enables proactive issue detection and debugging.</p>

        <h2><span>9. </span>User Guide for ArtistSearch</h2>
        <p>Welcome to ArtistSearch, the ultimate platform for discovering and exploring artists, music genres, and relationships between them. 
            This guide will help you navigate the application and utilize its features effectively.</p>
    
        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    
        <h4>Accessing the Application</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Web Version</strong>: The frontend is accessible via a web browser.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>Home Page</h4>
        <p>Upon entering the application, you will find the main navigation options that allow you to explore artists, 
            genres, and detailed analytics about the music industry.</p>
    
        <h3>Main Features</h3>
    
        <h4>Exploring Artists</h4>
        <p>The <strong>Artists Page</strong> allows users to browse a complete list of artists. Users can filter artists based on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time Period</strong>: Select artists based on their era.</li>
            <li><strong>Music Genre</strong>: Filter by the genre of music they perform.</li>
            <li><strong>Country of Citizenship</strong>: View artists based on their nationality.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Clicking on an artist opens a pop-up with detailed information about them. 
            Additionally, users have the option to export the artist's data in RDF format using the dedicated export button.</p>
    
        <h4>Visualizing Artist Relationships</h4>
        <p>Users can visualize how artists relate to their music genres through an interactive graph. 
            By clicking the designated button, a dynamic visualization is displayed, showing connections between artists and genres.</p>
    
        <h4>Comparing Two Artists</h4>
        <p>If two artists are selected, a comparison pop-up appears. This feature provides analytical insights into their careers, 
            styles, and similarities, supported by graphical representations.</p>
    
        <h4>Statistical Analysis of Artists</h4>
        <p>On the same page, users can access summarized insights about the distribution of artists. Three graphical representations display:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The number of artists per country.</li>
            <li>The number of artists per genre.</li>
            <li>The number of artists per decade.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These visualizations dynamically update according to the applied filters.</p>
    
        <h4>Exploring Music Genres</h4>
        <p>The <strong>Genres Page</strong> provides a comprehensive list of music genres. 
            A filtering option allows users to display only genres associated with a specific country. 
            Clicking on a genre reveals more information, including all its subgenres, which can be further explored.
            Additionally, users have the option to export the genre's data in RDF format using the dedicated export button.</p>
    
        <h3>Additional Features</h3>
    
        <h4>Intelligent Artist and Genre Recommendations</h4>  
        <p>The platform suggests artists based on their similarities with a given artist, on the artist detail pop-up. The recommendation system considers:</p>  
        <ul>  
            <li>Artists sharing at least one music genre with the selected artist.</li>  
            <li>Artists born within ±5 years of the selected artist.</li>  
            <li>Artists from different countries to ensure diversity.</li>  
        </ul>  
        <p>These recommendations help users discover new artists with related styles.</p>  

        <p>Additionally, on the <strong>Genre Page</strong>, at the bottom, users can explore two recommendation lists:</p>  
        <ul>  
            <li><strong>Recommended Genres</strong>: These are selected based on genres performed by artists who also perform the currently viewed genre.</li>  
            <li><strong>Recommended Artists</strong>: A list of artists who perform the selected genre, allowing users to explore musicians with similar styles.</li>  
        </ul>  
        <p>These additional recommendations enhance the discovery experience, helping users find both new artists and related music genres effortlessly.</p>

    
        <h3>Tips for a Better Experience</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use Filters</strong>: Narrow down searches efficiently to find relevant artists and genres.</li>
            <li><strong>Explore Graphs</strong>: Utilize visualizations to understand relationships between artists and genres.</li>
            <li><strong>Check Recommendations</strong>: Discover new artists based on intelligent filtering.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
        <p>For any issues, ensure you have a stable internet connection. If data appears outdated, allow some time for updates, 
            as the system periodically refreshes its cache.</p>
